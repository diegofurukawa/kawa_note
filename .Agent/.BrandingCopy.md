### Long-Form Positioning (Brand Story)
Kawa Note is a privacy-first knowledge management platform designed for professionals, researchers, and developers who refuse to compromise on data security. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that store your thoughts in plaintext on corporate servers, Kawa Note encrypts every note on your device before it ever leaves. Combined with semantic note relationships and a visual knowledge graph, Kawa Note transforms how you capture, organize, and connect ideas—all without anyone, including us, ever reading your data.

## Tone Guidelines

### DO:
- Be clear and direct (avoid jargon unless necessary)
- Use active voice (we encrypt, not encryption happens)
- Focus on benefits, not features (privacy, not encryption algorithm)
- Be confident but not arrogant (we're good, not the only option)
- Use specific language (not "fast", but "captures in <100ms")
- Show personality (friendly, technical, trustworthy)

### DON'T:
- Use startup clichés ("revolutionize", "disrupt", "next-gen")
- Make unverifiable claims ("best", "most secure")
- Use passive voice (avoid "is encrypted")
- Overcomplicate (explain like you're talking to a smart friend)
- Use ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Make it about us, make it about the user
